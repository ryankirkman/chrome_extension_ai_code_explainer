# AI Code Explainer

A Google Chrome extension that explains code. To use it select code, right click -> "Explain Code".

This was hacked together with GPT-4 (which did most of the work).

# Installation
1. [Load the unpackaged extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked)
2. Set your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) in the extensions options. The other default settings should work.

# Bugs
- Only use the right click menu -> "Explain Code". You can still click the extension icon, but it doesn't work as you expect. This is probably easy to fix.
- Probably lots of others
